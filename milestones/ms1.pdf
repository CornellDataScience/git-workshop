Teamwork Contract (30 minutes)
Aligning on the same goals and ground rules is important for building a great team! You
will write a teamwork contract together. Answer all of the following questions as part of
your contract. Reect carefully on them and be honest! When you reach moments of
challenge (and you will) go back to this contract. If that doesn’t help ask for advice, and
if that doesn’t help we can set up a team coaching session.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

We commit to clear communication, quality work, meeting deadlines, respecting each member's contributions, and working collaboratively toward shared success.

2. What are our "ground rules"? Don’t make an exhaustive list; stick with just a few.

Communicate openly and respectfully
Meet deadlines or notify the team early if there are issues
Come prepared to meetings
Listen to all perspectives before making decisions

3. How frequently will we communicate? How quickly are responses expected?
We'll establish regular check-ins (perhaps weekly), with an expectation that team messages receive responses within 24 hours during weekdays. Urgent matters should be flagged as such and addressed within a few hours when possible.

4. Where and how frequently will we meet? When is a person considered late to a
Meeting?

We'll meet weekly at an agreed time and location (virtual or in-person). A person is considered late after 5 minutes without notice. If someone needs to be late or absent, they should notify the team beforehand.

5. What team roles will we create? What are the responsibilities of each role? Will
roles shift around, and if so, how often?

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What exactly will we
say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? Or to a team
member who fails to deliver what was promised?

7. How will we make decisions as a team? What exactly will we do when we
disagree or discover conict? What will you use as a respectful conversation
Starter?

We haven’t settled upon this yet but we are thinking about one person rotates to record meeting details and everyone else comes prepared with ideas and code.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

We'll review this agreement monthly or whenever a team member requests it. Changes require consensus from all members.

9. How will we make this experience fun?

Celebrate milestones with small rewards
Occasional social gatherings outside work context
Appreciate contribution


For this milestone we did the required tasks and found a dataset to use and our project idea. 

We don't have many insights yet but we are looking into ideas.
