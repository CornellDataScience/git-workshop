    Our project is about analyzing user-priced lines on betting websites and comparing them to housed markets to try and find alpha. The theory behind this is that arbitrage always exists because housed markets are more efficient than user-priced lines. In practice, liquidity can be a significant concern. Regardless, our main dataset is taken from Kalshi via their API. Our goal is to use market structures to try and make profitable trades on Kalshi, potentially using data from sites like DraftKings or FanDuel in the process.

    1. Our first step was using the Kalshi API to access all markets from all time
    2. We then used keywords as well as ticker filters to extract sports-related lines from the total data
    3. We used pandas to create feature columns for the spread and other market structure features
    4. We cleaned the data of all invalid rows

    Most likely, we will begin with a simple Terminal User Interface (TUI), as our input data format is relatively simple. As our frontend development progresses, it is likely that we will implement a simple web app framework, potentially via Flask so the user can input files. The frontend is used so that the user can input a variety of data and get a betting amount according to their portfolio (Kelly criterion).

    We are using the Python Application workflow to manage our code. Current tests are not always passing because there are spare files in the Github that we will need to clean.
